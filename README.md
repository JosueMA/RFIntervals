# Random Forest Prediction Intervals

This repository contains R code and 60 datasets to reproduce the simulation studies and data analysis in the paper "Random Forest Prediction Intervals" by Haozhe Zhang, Joshua Zimmerman, Dan Nettleton, and Daniel J. Nordman.

A R package "RFIntervals" is under development. This package will produce out-of-bag prediction intervals, split conformal prediction intervals, and quantile regression forest intervals for random forest predictions, as well as random forest confidence intervals for estimated model mean functions.
